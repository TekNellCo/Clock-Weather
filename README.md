First attempt at using API's and making a digital clock

Overall im happy how it came out. The hardest part was probably the design itself. Since im not studying UI/UX I had to design what I felt looked good. I originally planned on doing 3 designs but I want to move on to more projects and not waste time on the last design.

Things I learned :

1. How to create an API.
2. Create a clock (ive done it before but I want to solidify it)
3. How to make the text gradient animation.
4. Adding classes to :root element. I didnt find out about this until my project was halfway finished.

Things I need to learn/practice :

1. Clean Code, I did no planning as I made this and it shows in the code. I will try to focus more on planning how a project will work before implementing it next time.
2. I need to practice on advanced css like 'calc'
3. I was surprised how easy it was to use the weather API. I want to practice more with API's
4. Practice themes with :root classes.
5. I should have used display : inherit on children popups. It wouldve saved me alot of code.
